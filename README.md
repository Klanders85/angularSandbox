<h2>Angular Sandbox Repo.</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<hr />
<p>This repo was created to save and view my progress while learning Angular.js. It became apparent that this was going to have a steep learning curve and saving things that worked as a reference is crucial.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>
<hr />
<p>At the root of this project you will find two files: <code>index.html</code> and <code>app.js</code> ... that's it</p>
<p>Open up <code>index.html</code> and you will notice that it is as pretty basic of a sandbox that you can get</p>
<p>Included in the <code>index.html</code> you will find the following...</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">Foundation(CDN)</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Angular.js(CDN)</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>To build further</h3>
<hr />
<p>If your sandbox becomes something cool that you want to add to this directory throw everything into its own directory and save it in github</p>
<p>Adding Sass is super-dupes easy just do the following</p>
<p>From the directory root</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open up <code>terminal</code></li>
	<li>make sure you are at the directory root</li>
	<li>run <code>mkdir css</code></li>
	<li>run <code>cd css</code></li>
	<li>run <code>touch main.css</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Thats it! From now on all you need to do is <code>cd</code> to the <code>css</code> directory and run <code>sass --watch main.scss:build/main.css --style compressed</code></p>
